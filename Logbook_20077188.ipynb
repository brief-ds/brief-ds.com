The best way to encode the three states is important, as simply detecting totals will not differentiate a cell of value 2 from two neighbouring cells of value 1. I believe that the most intuitive approach seems to encode each cell with a value in multiples of 10 such that the digits will correspons to the state of the cell. However, discussions with the group suggested that there are other approaches. Though to facilitate the understanding of code and make a more generalised program, I will implement my own method.

    "Having completed all the main sections of the project, I will now explore some variations of the forest fire as the 3-state automata could do with some more realistic modifications. The first modification was to create two additional states. These were baby trees and water. Baby trees were mostly an aesthetic contribution as it seemed more logical for a baby tree to first spawn randomly and then grow into an adult tree on the following time step. These behave exactly like adult trees and can catch fire when neighbouring burning trees. Water simply blockades the cells, it cannot catch fire, nor can trees grow on it. All functions were modified to include these extensions, as well as the color map.\n",

    "Another idea, is that of making the program more applicable on a practical level. I will attempt to use some libraries and `matplotlib` to interpret a selected image as the 2D space on which the forest fire will be evaluated. This could be thought as choosing an image of a region, say, a screenshot of a region in google maps.

Then, one can use the simulation to 'predict' the outcome of a forest fire in this environment.\n",
